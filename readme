Project Overview:
I developed a mobile application using the Flutter framework. Initially, the app was designed as a simple notes app that allowed users to input and save information. Later, I enhanced the app to collect and store more structured data from users.

Firebase Integration:
To store and manage the app’s data in the cloud, I integrated Firebase into the project. Below are the key steps involved:

1. Firebase Project Setup:
I created a new project on the Firebase Console, added my app’s package name, and downloaded the google-services.json file. This file was added to the android/app/ directory of my Flutter project.


2. Adding Firebase Dependencies:
In the pubspec.yaml file, I added the required Firebase packages, such as firebase_core and cloud_firestore, and ran flutter pub get to install them.


3. Initializing Firebase:
In the main.dart file, I initialized Firebase using the following commands:

WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
await Firebase.initializeApp();


4. Storing Data to Firestore:
I used TextEditingController to get user input and then stored the data into Firebase Cloud Firestore using:

FirebaseFirestore.instance.collection('users').add({
  'title': titleController.text,
  'note': noteController.text,
});


5. Reading Data from Firestore:
I used StreamBuilder in Flutter to fetch and display the stored data from Firebase in real time.



Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how to connect a Flutter app with Firebase for real-time cloud data storage. Firebase made it easy to handle backend services without the need for managing a custom server. The app is now capable of saving and retrieving user input efficiently.
